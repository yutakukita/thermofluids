        <h2 class="fade-left">Research Statement</h2>
        <p>My research is centred in fundamental problems in thermofluids coupling <b>multiphase flows</b>, <b>interfacial phenomena</b>, <b>wetting</b> and <b>phase change heat trasnfer</b>, primarily for systems involving <b>droplets</b> and <b>bubbles</b>.
          To better understand these problems, I develop and apply experimental techniques to capture new phenomena at various time and spatial scales.
          I also utilise theory and simulations to rationalise our experimental findings.
          My research is driven by a desire to develop more efficient energy systems, manufacturing, thermal management of electronics and biochemical processes.
        </p>
        <p>&ZeroWidthSpace;</p>
        <h3>-Why is this important?-</h3>
        <p>These are major challenges. Phase change has been known to offer the most efficient heat transfer characteristics; however, the complexity of the phenomena limits the applications.
          Better understanding the coupling of multiphase flow, wetting and phase change will enable us to <b>improve the energy efficiency in various industrial sectors</b>.
          For example, utilising <i>dropwise condensation</i> in steam power generation could reduce 20 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> globally.
          Better control of spray cooling could reduce 0.9 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> from steel manufacturing which is highly energy consuming.
          Moreover, energy consumption of data centres and power devices are expected to reach 20% of total global energy demand by 2030, and its 40% is spent for cooling the microchips.
          Phase change cooling is the last resort to aid thermal crisis of electronics and power devices and could reduce 19 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> annually.
          Furthermore, accurate models to predict the evaporation and resultant flows are essential for <b>optimising coating and drying processes</b>.
          In addition to improving current applications, my research also aims to <b>develop novel droplet-based devices</b>.
          For example, I have established a technique to transport droplets and control their flow by imposing wettability and thermal gradients.
          This method enables droplets to act as microreactors in microfluidic systems used for bioanalyis e.g. PCR testing.
        </p>

          <figcaption>Examples of research topics on droplets and applications</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>-Methodology-</h3>
        <p>In addition to conventional temperature sensing, I use / develop imaging techniques e.g. <b>high-speed imaging, infrared thermography, interferometry, schlieren and fluorescent / phosphorescent techniques</b> to obtain transient flow / temperature / concentration fields.
          These help to explore unseen phenomena, understand the mechanisms, and to validate theories / models of multiphase flows and heat transfer.
          I am an <b>expert in wettability analysis</b> using self-made or commercial (e.g. KRÜSS DSA) goniometers.
          I have also worked with <b>microfabrication labs</b> to make patterned surfaces and used MEMS heater arrays / temperature sensors.
          I have used an <b>environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM)</b> to study phase change process at nano / micro scale.
          Furthermore, I am well experienced in surface characterisation usin SEM, laser conforcal microscopy, optical microscopy and profilometry.
          I also use <b>COMSOL</b> for simple numerical modelling to better interpret experimental observations.
        </p>
        <p>&ZeroWidthSpace;</p>
        <h3>-Past research projects-</h3>
        <p><b>Falling-Film Heat Exchangers:</b> I developed a design formula for this type of heat exchangers.
          Heat transfer characteristics have been analysed both experimentally and theoretically.
          The heat exchanger has been commercialised for heat recovery from hot spring, geothermal utilisation and instant cooling of coffee.
        </p>
        <p><b>Evaporation of Volatile Drops in Humid Environment:</b> Effect of a secondary component in atmosphere e.g. moisture on the evaporation of organic solvent drops had been overlooked although it could be a source of prediction errors.
          I tackled this problem using infrared thermography and optical imaging.
          Adsorption, absorption and / or condensation of water into the drops was directly observed and quantified for the first time by gas chromatography.
          Finally, I proposed a model that accounts for vapour transfer to and from drops, which could assist in optimising inkjet and coating processes.
        </p>
        <p><b>Wettability-Driven Drop Transport:</b> Drop transport on surfaces has many potential applications such as self-cleaning, heat transfer and microfluidic devices.
          Wettability patterning is a passive way to drive drop motion; albeit limited successful report on spontaneous motion.
          I tested drop mobility on various combinations of wettability patterns fabricated via microtexturing.
          I proposed a universal theory to predict the criterion for spontaneous drop motion.
        </p>
        <p><b>Controlling Thermocapillary Flows in Water Drops:</b> Manipulating flows in drops are paramout to future microfluidic devices where drops act as microreactors.
          I succeeded, for the first time, to induce thermocapillary-driven vortices in pure water drops, the existence of which had been controversial.
          The flows are driven by localised heating with a laser.
          Infrared thermography revealed the nature of instabilities.
          I have also demonstrated to control flow velocity and direction by turning heating power and location.
        </p>
        <p>&ZeroWidthSpace;</p>
        <h3>-Ongoing research projects-</h3>
        <p><b>Droplet Impingement Cooling - from droplet to spray levels:</b> Despite the highest cooling capacity it can offer, detailed mechanisms governing spray cooling are still far from understood.
          I collaborate with JFE Steel Corporation to investigate the fundamental process of wetting, heat transfer and evaporation of droplets impacting a heated surface.
          So far, I have provided a model to predict the transition from film boiling to nucleate boiling (termed as <i>quenching</i> in steel industry), which had been an open question for half a centry.
          Extending the knowledge derived from the droplet-level experiments to the spray level, I have successfully demonstrated to simulate thermal histories of steel plates until quenching.
          These findings will not only be a breakthrough into the optimisation of steelmaking process, but also informs the design of nuclear reactor and microelectronics.
        </p>
        <p><b>Dropwise Condensation:</b> Although dropwise condensation (DWC) offers much higher heat transfer coefficients than filmwise condensation (FWC), condensers used in power generation are operated in FWC.
          This is due to the poor understanding of the mechanism triggering a shift from DWC to FWC.
          Numerous researchers focus on droplet evolution without completing the task of quantifying resultant heat transfer.
          To address this shortage, I am developing a novel thermal imaging system based on phosphorescent principles, which allows to simultatneously capture both droplet behaviour and transient local temperatures.
        </p>
        <p>&ZeroWidthSpace;</p>
        <h3>-Future research directions-</h3>
        <p>Due to the complex, multiphysics, multiscale and transient nature, multiphase flows and heat transfer are far from understood.
          In addition to developing novel experimental techniques, I will design collaborative research with modelling experts to capture complete physical phenomena.
          Key questions I will tackle include:
        </p>
        <ul class="cv-list">
          <li>the interplay of hydrodynamics, heat and mass transfer, interfacial phenomena and wetting;</li>
          <li>nano / microscopic features;</li>
          <li>transient characteristics;</li>
          <li>and how they result in macroscopic performance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&ZeroWidthSpace;</p>
        <h3>-Research leadership-</h3>
        <p>My major publications are in top 10% journals ub the field of thermofluids.
          I also serve as a reviewer of these journals.
          My research receives growing recognition such as awards by international and national academic societies and around 10 invited talks at international and national events.
        </p>
        <p><b>Internationally,</b> I am active in the field of phase change heat transfer research through internationa collaborations, mostly with Japan, US and EU-based institutions.
        I am a member of the cross-continental EU MSCA-RISE ThermaSMART Project.
        In December 2019, I organised an international symposium with ThermaSMART, hosting about 60 international experts in multiphase flow and heat transfer (UK: 18, US: 2, South Africa: 2, China: 2, Brazil: 1, Poland: 1, Ireland: 1, France: 1, Japan: 30).
        I am a regular contributor of Gordon Research Conference on Nano / Micro Phase Change Heat Transfer, UK Heat Transfer Conference (UKHTC), International Heat Transfer Conference (IHTC), American Physical Society Divition of Fluid Dynamics (APSDFD), International Conference on Boiling and Condensation Heat Transfer (ICBCHT).
        I am a founding member, representing Japan (then), of Thermal Transport Café, which is a new virtual international community of thermal engineers coordinated with the support of MIT and National Science Foundation, US.
        I gave an invited talk at the second Thermal Transport Café virtual seminar in Feb 2021.
        </p>
        <p><b>In Japan,</b> I am an active member of Thermal Engineering Division of the Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers (JSME) and Heat Transfer Society of Japan (HTSJ).
          My research has been recognised by these communities as demonstrated by being invited to speak at Seminar of Reseach Committee of Phase Change and Interface sponsored by JSME.
          I also received Young Researcher Awards by HTSJ in 2020 and by JSME in 2022.
          I have led the field of droplets in the communities.
          I am a founding organiser of the droplet session in JSME Thermal Engineering Conference in 2021, and I have also organised a similar session in National Heat Transfer Symposium in 2022 for the first time.
