      Our UK-based research group, led by Dr. Yutaku Kita in the Department of Engineering at King's College London, focuses on fundamental problems in thermofluids.
      We study the coupling of multiphase flow, wetting, and heat and mass transfer, primarily for systems involving droplets and bubbles.
      Our research is driven by a desire to develop more efficient energy systems, as well as to improve manufacturing and biological processes.
